# [Homepage](../index.html)

The theoretical exercises described below are quite [difficult]{.orange}. At the [exam]{.blue}, you can expect a [simplified version]{.blue} of them; otherwise, they would represent a formidable challenge for most of you.

On the other hand, the data analyses are more or less aligned with what you may encounter in the final examination.

:::callout-tip
The vast majority of these exercises are taken from the textbooks @Salvan2020 and @Agresti2015, possibly with a few minor modifications. You can consult these textbooks if you need additional exercises.

## Data analysis

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### `Basketball` dataset

The `Basketball` dataset can be [downloaded here](../data/Basketball.dat) and shows the three-point shooting, by game, of Ray Allen of the Boston Celtics during the 2010 NBA (basketball) playoffs (e.g, he made $0$ of $4$ shots in game $1$). Commentators remarked that his shooting varied dramatically from game to game.

In the $i$th game, suppose that $S_i = m_i Y_i$ is the number three-points shots made out of $m_i$ attempts is distributed as $S_i \sim \text{Binomial}(m_i, \pi_i)$, and that the $S_i$ are independent.

Import the data and then

(a) Fit the null model, with $\pi_i = \pi$. Find and interpret the estimate $\hat{\pi}$, obtain its standard error and a confidence interval.

(b) Is there evidence of overdispersion? Motivate your answer based on the data. 

(b) Describe a factor that could cause [overdispersion]{.blue}. Adjust the standard error for overdispersion and obtain another confidence interval based on this correction.

(c) Compare the two confidence intervals and interpret the results.

#### `Bioassay` dataset

The data in the `Bioassay` dataset, available in the `MLGdata` library, refer to a biological experiment (Finney, 1947, Table 9). The variable `y` represents the number of observed events out of a total of subjects ( `den`) exposed to a dose `z`.

(a) Fit a binomial model with a probit link function. 

(b) To check for possible overdispersion, consider a quasi-likelihood model, also evaluating the standard errors using a robust approach.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
##### `Germination` dataset (continuation)

Reconsider the `Germination` dataset previously analyzed in [Exercises C](exe_C.html).

Evaluate the possible presence of [overdispersion]{.orange}, and compare the results obtained from fitting the different models that account for it. Propose a [final model]{.blue} and interpret the results.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### `Homicide` dataset (continuation)

Reconsider the `Homicide` dataset previously analyzed in [Exercises D](exe_D.html).

(a) Evaluate the possible presence of [overdispersion]{.orange}.

(b) Construct an approximate 95% confidence interval for the ratio of the mean number of reported homicides between White and Black respondents, using both the Poisson and a quasi-likelihood approach. Comment on the results.

## Theoretical

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### Exercise A

Does the inflated-variance quasi-likelihood approach make sense as a way to generalize the ordinary normal model with $v(\mu_i) = \sigma^2$? Why or why not?

:::

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
#### Exercise B

Altham (1978) introduced the discrete distribution
$$
f(x; \pi, \theta) = c(\pi, \theta) \binom{n}{x}\pi^x(1 - \pi)^{n - x}\theta^{x(n-x)}, \qquad x = 0, 1,\dots, n,
$$
where $c(\pi, \theta)$ is a normalizing constant. 

Show that this is in the two-parameter exponential family and that the binomial occurs when $\theta = 1$. 

[Comment]{.blue}: Altham noted that overdispersion occurs when $\theta < 1$. Lindsey and Altham (1998) used this as the basis of an alternative model to the beta-binomial.
